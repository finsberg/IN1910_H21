In later lectures we will turn to some examples on how we can use this randomness for different algorithms and scientific problems, and also how we can do testing on stochastic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomness is important for many scientific applications, and many different problems and algorithms need access to be able to draw elements or samples at random. Also in other parts of programming, randomness can be an important topic. Most games for example, have a considerable component of randomness. Another major field that needs randomness is *cryptography*, which is needed to communicate securely, a crucial component of everything on the internet for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the coming lectures, we will show some examples of using randomness, but for now, we simply state it: randomness is a [valuable commoditiy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_randomness). We therefore need to know how to generate it.\n"

    "\n",
    "People have been generating random numbers by mechanical means for millenia, for example by throwing dice, spinning roluette wheels, shuffling cards, and so on. While these techniques might mostly be connected to games and gambling, we can use them to produce randomness for use in scientific studies, statistics and so on as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sitting at producing your own random numbers by rolling a die is cumbersome and time consuming. To get around this and make the task of producing randomness easier, random number tables would be distributed. These were simply random numbers that were generated, and then tabulated into large tables. As the tables already are random, it doesn't matter how you read these tables, you can go by row, by column, or diagonally for example. But having access to a random number table makes life easier if you need a few random samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasise the importance of random numbers, you can take a look at the book *A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates*, first published in 1955 by the RAND company. As the name implies, this is a book of a millon random digits. The interesting thing however, is that this book was considered quite groundbreaking, as it enabled more people access to a large number of random numbers than ever before.\n",

    "## Randomness on Computers\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of computers and computing, it was clear that having access to random numbers in a computer program would also be a valuable asset. However, there is an issue, because computers were created to be entirely stable and *deterministic*. There was simply no way for a computer to produce a random number from nothingness. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution was to \"import\" random numbers from outside sources. The RAND coorperations book *A million random digits* for example, also came in the format of punch cards, so that they could be read into the computers memory and used by a program. This process was however, very slow, and having access to a sufficient number of sufficiently random numbers was challening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where did this randomness that was imported actually come from? These were taken from some physical setup that measured some seemingly random process. *A million random digits* for example, were taken from an electric roulette wheel connected to a large computer that kept spinning the wheel and noting the results. In modern days, many other physical systems for randomness have been proposed and used. Lava lamps have for example been popular, as the movement of the \"lava\" as it moves around and breaks up and merges together can be measured by an electric sensor and seemling produces random outputs. Other options are looking at radioactive decay with a geiger counter, looking at thermal fluctations or quantum mechanical noise. These are just some examples, and there are countless more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical means of producing random numbers are still used today, the website [random.org](https://www.random.org/) for example, uses *atmospheric noise* to generate random numbers, the noise is measured by radio and tabulated into random number tables, which is then used when randomness is needed."

    "\n",
    "Now, earlier, we said that this is problematic, because computers are fully deterministic machines, and this is still true. There is no way for a computer to produce non-deterministic randomness, if it is not connected to some physical RNG. However, in scientific programming, what we care about in our random numbers is the *statistics*. That means, even though they might be deterministic, if we can get the computer to produce numbers that look and behave like random numbers, from a statistical sense, then it will be sufficient for our purposes. We call this *statistically* random numbers. This concept is called [statistical randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_randomness).\n",

    "In the rest of this lecture we will look at examples on how a computer can produce *statistical randomness* that is sufficient for scientific applications.

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, the LCG we have created spits out a bunch of large integers. And it is at least hard to predict what number comes next. However, to have any use of the numbers that are outputted, we need to at least know the range of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the next number in the sequence, we multiply the current state by $a=1664525$, and then increment it by $c=1013904223$. Both of these are massive numbers, to we would expect the state of the system to grow by quite a large margin. However, it does not grow beyond all bounds, because the last step is to take the modulo.\n",
    "$$X_{n+1} = aX_n + c \\mod m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) of a number means finding the remainder after division. It is an importat operation in number theory. We won't cover it in detail here, but a nice analogy for the modulo operation is a clock. A normal clock face shows numbers in the range $[0, 12)$, once it goves beyond 12, it starts back at 0. This is effectively a modulo operation. For example, 17:00 on a 24-hour clock would be $17 \\ \\text{mod}\\ 12 = 5$ on a 12-hour clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our LCG, we always take the modulo with $m$. This means, just like for the clock, every time our state grows beyond $m$, it \"loops back around. Thus, we are guaranteed that any number output by our LCG will be a number in the range:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[0, m),$$\n",
    "or for our given choice of parameters:\n",
    "$$[0, 2^{32}) = [0, 4294967296).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now. This gives a range for possible values our LCG potentially can output. Are we guaranteed that every single integer in this range can, and will, be output? No, not in general no, but let us assume that this is the case.  The range $[0, 2^{32})$ includes exactly $2^{32}$ integers, so if all possible values in this range are possible, or LCG can then output $2^{32}$ different outcomes. For our LCG to be considered statistically random, we would want all of these outcomes to be equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because we are doing the modulo operation at the end, we can envision our LCG working by spinning the handle of a clock around. Because we multiply $a$ by the previous state $X$, the amount the handle of the clock moves in the next iteration is not a constant length, but dependent on the pseudorandom number $X$. Moving the handle a random amount around the clock gives the next number in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, an interesting question is why we have chosen exactly $m=2^{32}$ as our range. Well, recall that an `int` in C++, and most other programming languages, are precisely 32 bits. As a bit can be either 0 or 1, that means a normal integer in most programming languages can have $2^{32}$ possible values. As we draw non-negative numbers, our LCG produces unsigned integers, but these can be stored in an unsigned int variable, which we define in C++ as `usigned int`. In other words, by choosing $m=2^{32}$, we are producing exactly one possible 32-bits integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, it shouldn't come as a surprise that another popular choice for the modulus is $m=2^{64}$, which is the size of a `long` integer in C++ and other programming languages. A benefit of sticking to modulus that are strictly powers of $2^n$ is that computing the modulus is as simple as throwing away the unimportant bits, a process known as *truncating*. This is extremely fast on a computer, much faster than computing the actual modulo, and choosing $m=2^n$ will therefore give a fast LCG."

    "## Seeding and Reproducability\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that a pRNG needs to start at a given *seed state* to be able to produce a sequence of pseudorandom numbers. It is up to the user of the system to select a seed, and feed it into the pRNG. The choice of the seed will impact what sequence of numbers we get. If we choose a different seed, we get a different sequence out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because each iteration of the pRNG is a deterministic computation, if we choose the *same seed state*, we get the same exact output. You might have noticed this already, if you execute the same examples in this notebook so far, we get the exact same output, the \"random\" numbers do not change whatsowever, untill you change the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the fact that \"random\" numbers do not change on execution, but are 100% determined by the seed might feel like a major flaw of the system. However, recall that the goal is not to produce *true* random numbers, but *statistically* random numbers. The fact that the seed perfectly predicts the outcome is actually a major benefit!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the same seed produces the same \"random\" sequence, it means that our code is *reproducible* and much easier to test. In fact, this is one of the big reasons pRNGs exist in the first place. Von Neumann developed the middle-square method not only for speed, but also because he found it impossible to test and reproduce his code run with punch cards supplied random numbers. Of course, he could simply write down the sequence the random numbers where supplied into the program in, but the computer did not have close to enough memory to remember all these numbers. With his method however, to reproduce and test the program, you would simply need to remember a single number, the *seed state*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A somewhat silly example of this is the game Minecraft. In Minecraft, the whole world is *procedurally generated*, meaning the world you start in is randomly generated following a set of rules. This means that every game of minecraft should have a completely unique world. However, perhaps you find a really cool world some time, and want to share it with a friend. Well, you would be in luck, because the Minecraft RNG used to randomly generated these worlds is a pRNG, and so if you simply feed in the correct *seed state* to this pRNG, you would end up with the same world. Minecraft uses this intentionally, and for any new world created, you can find the *seed* state of the world, which is basically a long number.\n",

From that point onwards, the sequence just repeats itself in exactly the same manner.

    "The number of values a pRNG produces before it repeats itself is called its *period*. For our example, the period was 6, because it produced six numbers before repeating itself. It's important when we use a pRNG that we do not exhaust its period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our example LCG was purposfully very simple, to illustrate a short period. But note that while this LCG technically has 9 possible outcomes, because $m=9$, the period is shorter than 9. This is true for any LCG, if our LCG has $m=2^{32}$, then we know that the period is *at most* $2^{32}$. This is again because of the Pigeonhole princicple, we simply have to hit a repeated number if we reach $2^{32}+1$ numbers, as we have exhausted all options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for an LCG, the period is at *most* $2^{32}$, but it can be much shorter. And this is were good choices of $a$ and $c$ comes in, as we want to choose values that maximized the period. Note also that the seed also impacts the period. Normally, when we talk about the *period* of a pRNG, we refer to the longest possible period, if we choose the right seed. Seeds that produce cycles of shorter periods than the ideal are often called *bad seed states*. A good pRNG should not really have *bad seed states*, because it is unreasonable to assume our user knows what seeds to avoid."

If we use our pRNG to draw random points in a unit cube, if our pRNG is behaving as it should, these points will spread out uniformly in the cube, but if there is correlation between the different samples produced by the pRNG, we will see patterns forming in these random points. For most pRNGs we have to move to high dimensions before we can see these patterns, but for RANDU they show up even in 3D."

    "\n",
    "In all our examples so far, the *state* of the pRNG is simply the previously outputted number. However, there is a problem with this approach, because it means we cannot get *repeated* outcomes. For any truly random sequence, we sometimes expect repeated outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is to create a pRNG that has a larger internal state, and then returns only parts o f that state. For example, an LCG might use a modulus of $m=2^{64}$, meaning the state has 64 bits of information, however, when actually returning the ouput to the user, they might only use certain parts of this number, such as extracting for example $48$ bits of information. For an LCG, it is common to return the most significant bits in this way, because it can be shown that these bits have a longer period than the lower bits.\n",

    "By only returning parts of the state, we ensure that we can actually get the same output multiple times, without the state being the same and producing a low period.\n",
    "\n",
    "A test of a pRNG testing this is called *the birthday test*, because it is based on the [Birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). The Birthday problem is as follows: In a room of $n$ people, what is the chance that at least two people share the same birthday? Assuming that the birthdays of people in the room are random, it effectively asks the chance of drawing the same random sample from a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Birthday problem has the surprising answer that with only 23 people in the room, there is a bigger than 50% chance that two people share a birthday, and that increases to a staggering 99.9% with just 70 people! By generalizing the problem, we can test wether an RNG gives us the expected number of repeated samples for a given distributions. Many simpler pRNGs fail the birthday test."
