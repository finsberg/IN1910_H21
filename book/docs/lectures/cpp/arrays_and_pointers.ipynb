    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture, we covered the vector data type, which behaved much like a Python list. However, there is a more lower level and fundamental data structure in C++ that can be very usefulâ€”arrays. You might be familiary with numpy arrays in Python, and while these are based on C arrays (which is why we call them numpy *arrays*), they are also more fancy, with additional functionality built-in. The arrays we will talk about here are a low-level structure, making them fairly \"primitive\", but also efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an array?\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a sequence of elements stored *contiguously* in memory. Contiguously means that each element follows each other directly in memory. Machine hardware can more effectively access and iterate over contiguous memory, making arrays efficient in both speed and size. Because the elements are to be stored contiguously, an array takes up a given chunk of memory and we cannot generally shrink or expand it, as there is no guarantee that the memory we want to expand into is free. In addition, all elements in an array has to be of the same datatype. While all of these properties might sound restrictive, they are what leads to arrays being so efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, arrays are:\n",
    "* A sequence of elements of a single datatype\n",

    "\n",
    "You might expect that all 100 elements were set to 0, as we just created a new array, but this is not the case. Rather, what happens when we define the array is that the memory required to store the 100 doubles is requested from the system, and this memory is *allocated*, meaning it is made available. However, what is stored in that memory isn't actually changed, so the initial values of the elements is therefore whatever was stored in that memory previously, and so it is effectively random. You can check this yourself by initializing an array, and writing out all the values.\n",

However, arrays are more low-level than the sequences you might be used to, and so there will be no fancy operations available, such as slicing. Another point that might be a bit unusual for you is that an array does not remember its own size, and there is no built in size operator you can use to easily find it either! However it is possible to find the size by computing the amount to memory that is required to store the array using the function `sizeof`. For example \n",

    "int size = sizeof(primes) / sizeof(primes[0])\n",

    "then `size` would be $5$. However, you should be careful with using this syntax when arrays are passed as arguments to functions. In these cases only a pointer to the first elements is passed which does necessarly not take up the same amount of memory as the whole array. As a rule of thumb you should also keep track of the size of arrays yourselves."

    "#### Small note on call by value vs call by reference\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major benefits of using a call-by-reference is that you avoid copying the object you are using as your argument, which can be efficient with regards to both speed and memory. To see why, imagine you are working on some huge vector of data with millions of elements. If every time you call a function to do something with this vector, you had to copy the entire thing, you would use twice the memory and maybe some time for the actually copying of memory. Instead, if you could just call by reference you could read and work on the actual memory where it is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if call by reference is more memory efficient, why don't we just always use that? While calling by reference is efficient memory wise, it can also lead to side effects a lot more easily, and thus more easily lead to bugs. Most often when calling a function, you do not expect the input argument to be changed, and it would be confusing and hard to find bugs if all functions could change variables at any time. Thus calling by value is a better default, as one should need to be very explicit if one wants to break from the default conventions. Besides, copying simpler objects such as int and doubles has so little overhead it won't be noticable, it is only for larger, more complex data structures where there is real gain in call by reference.\n",

Hopefully, after reading through this lecture, you will realize that it actually is a sort of mix.

    "\n",
    "Earlier we briefly mentioned that in C++ datatypes are not mutable or immutable in the same manner as in Python, instead we can declare any variable to be immutable when we define it. To do so, you can use the keyword `const`, short for \"constant\". The term constant is perhaps more descriptive than immutable, but the two mean the same, the object cannot change over time, it is constant.\n",

    "```C++\n",
    "MAX_ITERATIONS++;\n",
    "```\n",
    "You would get an error message when compiling:\n",

    "error: increment of read-only variable â€˜MAX_ITERATIONSâ€™\n",
    "```\n",

    "Using the const keyword can for example be useful to define parameters or constants you know you need to set once, and won't need to be changed after compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The const keyword can also be used when defining a call-by-reference, when you want to pass in large, complex data to a function in an efficient way, but you do not actually want the data to be changed, just read. You could for example create the following function:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the `const` keyword isn't really *needed*, but we add it for two important reasons. First of it makes our code more understandable, as when someone reads the function signature, they immediately see that the data input isn't changed, despite it being a call-by-reference. And secondly, it is a safeguard against bugs, because having the const keyword, making a change to the actual vector will cause a compile error.
