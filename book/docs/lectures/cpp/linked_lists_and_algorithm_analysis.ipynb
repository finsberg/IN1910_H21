    "\n",
    "This lecture marks the start of a new topic in IN1910, namely the Algorithms and Data Structures part of the course, which we will spend the next two weeks on. We have spent the *previous* two weeks of IN1910 learning some C++. As mentioned, the main goal of learning C++ was to familiarize you with C-style programming syntax. We are through covering new material in C++, but will spend the next two weeks using it for our exploration of data structures, so you will get further possibility to learn to use the language more.\n",

    "### Data Structures and Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A data structure is how data is organized and managed. More precisely, it is about how a collection of data items are stored collectively, how they relate to each other, and what operations we can perform on them. Understanding data structures is important when trying to make efficient programs, because different problems and implementations calls for different data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are tightly connected to data structures, because to implement a data structure, we need to understand the algorithms needed to get that data structure to work. But also because implementing an algorithm to solve some problem will rely on what data structure you choose to work with, different underlying structures call for different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures and Algorithms is one of the fundamental topic of computer programming, and if you want to work as a software developer, you really need to know it. This is reflected in the fact that there are numerous books and university classes called precisely \"Data Structures and Algorithms\", or alternatively: \"Algorithms and Data Structures\". We only have a few weeks dedicated to this topic, so it is obvious that we cannot give you a proper introduction into the topic. However, we aim to give you a small taste, and an understanding of what a data structure actually is and why it is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "At UiO, the course [IN2010 – Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN2010/index-eng.html) (previously INF2220) focuses more in-depth on the topic, and comes highly recommended for anyone who wants to become a better programmer, and it's pretty much a prerequisite course to take if you want to go further into computer science. Note that IN2010 uses Java as its language, but having learned some C++, the course will build on what we do in IN1910 quite nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, there are also hundreds of books on this subject, some probably better than others. Not only are there many to choose from, there are probably several to choose from dedicated for each programming language you might want to use. We will recommend the book used by IN2010, [*Algorithm Design and Application* by Goodrich and Tamassia](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Algorithm+Design+and+Applications-p-9781118335918) as that is probably the best choice if you want to get a dedicated book and might be taking IN2010 in the future.\n",

    "Another excellent resource to use are the teaching materials for the [MIT course 6.006 *Introduction to Algorithms*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/). The course materials are openly available through Open CourseWare, with recorded video lectures. This course covers the theory behind many data structures and algorithms, and so works well with any programming language, but mostly uses Python for example code. Note that 6.006 goes into many topics we won't cover, but they also have lectures that cover what we do in IN1910."

    "## Data Structures vs Abstract Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture, L12, we covered [Dynamic Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array), also known as Array Lists. And this is an example of a data structure, as it is a specification on how data values are to be stored, and interacted with. In that lecture, we implemented a class, and then had to continuously swap to think between how things worked \"inside the class\", and how they looked from \"outside the class\", i.e., how the class is actually used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to formalize these concepts a bit. The term *data structure* refers to the specific and concrete implementation of how data is represented and stored. It is a low-level construct, that we mostly have to think about when *implementing* something.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the class however, we instead talk about the *data type*, or even the [*abstract data type*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) (ADT). An abstract data type is, as the name implies, a more abstract definition and is a mathematical model for the behavior of the construct from the *users* perspective. Specifically it is the collection of possible values to be stored in the construct, the possible operations on that data, and the behavior of those operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So data structure is the low-level construct from the perspective of the implementer, while the abstract data type is the high-level construct, built on top of the data structure, which is what the user actually interacts with.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an abstract data type is the [list ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)). This is a specification that a *list* is something which can store a sequence of elements, has methods to find the number of elements stored, methods for inserting or appending new elements, etc. You should be familiar with this ADT, because Python lists for example, would be a specific implemention of this list ADT. Another example of an ADT is the [associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), while the name might be unfamiliar to you, you have probably used this ADT, because python dictionaries are associative arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we want to implemenet to specific ADT, say for example a list, there will often be many different underlying data structures we can choose when we implement it. In the case of the list, dynamic arrays would be a natural choice, as we have already seen. Another option would be *linked lists*, a data structure we will cover in this lecture. \n",

    "<center><b>Figure 1:</b> An abstract data type is the interface the user has to interact with, it defines the possible operations on the data and how they behave. The underlying data structure is more specific to how data is represented and stored in memory, it is mostly the implementer who has to think about the data structure. As shown, different data structures can be used to implement a given ADT, lists can for example be made with dynamic arrays *or* with linked list. This will be different from the perspective of the implementer. But when using the class, we won't really need to think about the underlying data structure, as the same operations will be supported.</center>\n",

    "We now turn to look at linked lists, which is an alternative data structure to dynamic arrays for implementing lists. Unlike dynamic arrays, linked lists do not rely on storing data in arrays, but instead store each element of the list in an individual structure we call a *node*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node object stores the value of the element itself, but it also contains a pointer to another node. We can use this pointer to *link* different nodes to each other and create a *linked list*. In this lecture we will only consider lists that store *integers*. However, the value field of the nodes could simply be changed to store any kind of object. In C++, it would be best to use *templating* to define a single list class that can contain any type of data, but we disregard this here to keep things as simple as possible.\n",

Plotting a plot of run time vs number of elements, $t(n)$, shows us how the sorting algorithm scales with the input size.\n",

Having to implement all of them first, means we don't save any time. (2) For testing large inputs, executing an algorithm can actually take really long.\n",

For each iteration, we will assign the counter `i` (1 operation), we will perform one comparison between `biggest` and the next element in the list (2 operations, one for the comparison and one for the indexing).

An algorithm that is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ scales *quadratically*, meaning that doubling the problem size will quadruple the cost of the algorithm.\n",

This means the cost of multiplying matrices grows very fast as the size of the matrices grow. If the matrices double in size, the cost increases by almost tenfold.\n",

    "Now, interestingly enough, the $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost we find for the \"naive\" matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm turns out to be sub-optimal. Several clever techniques have been found to optimize this multiplication and make it scale better. This is very important for linear algebra computations involving large matrices, of which many exist.\n",

    "Looking at the graph and the improvements found over time, it is easy to start to wonder where it will end, and as of now, the theoretical optimal scaling of matrix-matrix multiplication is unknown. However, we do know that there is a theoretical limit of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, simply due to the fact that two multiply the $n \\times n$ matrices together requires at least reading out the elements of those matrices, which in itself is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. However, wether it is actually possible to make an algorithm that reaches $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ is not known, no one has been able to prove, or disprove, that this limit is reachable."
