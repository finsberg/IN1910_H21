At this point we encounter a null pointer, as the \"4\" node does not have a child at its right pointer.

    "While the order of insertion is also important for the structure of our binary search tree, it won't affect what is printed by in-order traversal of our tree, because this is in sorted order. In fact, it would be *impossible* to print out things in *insertion* order from a BST, because the structure doesn't store this information! \n",

However, now do the same exercise, inserting the elements into a binary search tree instead, and you will find that both trees will have the exact same structure. Thus, these two trees cannot be differentiated on their input order. To verify, draw out the trees yourself and check this.\n",

All we are trying to point out is that a tree does not remember the insertion order in the same manner as lists.\n",
