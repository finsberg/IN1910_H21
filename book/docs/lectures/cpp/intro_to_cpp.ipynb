    "\n",
    "This week we will start to turn to a new programming language, C++. We will use this language, in combination with Python, for the rest of the course. You will learn how to read and write short C++ programs, and how to compile and run them. Our goal is to make you at least somewhat familiar with C-style code, and also to make you aware of the major differences between Python and C++. Note however, that the world of C++ is big, and to get proficient at C++ one has to dedicate a lot of time and effort to it, certainly more than we have time for in IN1910. The goal is therefore to give you a taste of the language and an overview that can come in handy down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ is a hard language to learn, and also a hard language to use. There is a joke in the programming world, that everyone should learn C++ as their first language, because after that any other language will seem easy. While that might be an exaggeration, it is definitely a more technical language than Python. The best piece of advice we can give you before we start is simply: *don't panic*. We don't expect you to become experts in this course, and so the goal is more that you can write some cool programs, rather than take away all the fundamentals.\n",

    "The book *Object-Oriented Programming in Python*, written by by Michael H. Goldwasser and David Letscher \n",
    "has a supplemental document called *A Transition Guide from Python 2.x to C++*. Both the book and supplement are freely available as pdf-files on the [book's website](http://cs.slu.edu/~goldwamh/oopp/). The supplement is ~90 pages, and covers most of what we will use in this course. It can be a good document to work through if you prefer reading on your own above lectures. The supplement is written for Python 2, but the differences are so small, this should be of no big concern.\n",

    "#### The definitive C++ book guide and list\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a dedicated C++ book, there exist many out there. I would recommend reading through StackOverflow's [Definitive C++ Book Guide and List](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list) to find one that is worthy of both your time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why C++?\n",
    "\n",
    "So why are we learning C++ as our second language? \n",
    "\n",
    "C++, like many other languages, is based on C. C is an old language, created in 1972, but still sees wide use today. It is a low-level language that compiles into highly efficient machine code—put simply, C is blazing fast. While C is important historically, it is still one of the most used languages today. A lot of much used software, such as UNIX and the main implementation of Python, is written mainly in C. \n",
    "\n",
    "C++ is a direct extension of the C programming language, with the motivation of adding classes to the language. The syntax and semantics of the two languages are therefore nearly identical. The major difference is that C++ has larger standard libraries and more support for higher level constructs, such as object-oriented programming. C++ still retains most of the low-level features of C however, and if implemented correctly, will be highly efficient and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several other popular languages are also, at least partially, based on C, such as C# and Objective-C. Other languages, like Java, borrow most of their syntax from C. While Java is very different \"under the hood\", and runs quite different from C, the code itself looks quite a bit alike. In short, many, many languages today have a strong \"C-flavor\" to them, and dedicated programmers are more or less expected to know some C-style language.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize: We want to learn a C-style language, because it is extremely useful for any programmer to know one of these languages, as it makes learning any of the others a lot easier. We also want to have a highly efficient language, to be capable of making fast and large computations. This requirement means we prefer to choose C or C++ over Java. Lastly, as we are learning object-oriented programming in this course, C++ is the natural choice over C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok. Enough talk, let's get to learning some actual C++!\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to write, compile and run C++ programs\n",
    "\n",
    "As our first introduction to the language, let us write a *Hello, World* program. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file called `hello_world.cpp`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you can already note that `.cpp` is a file extension for C++ source code, i.e., the file we write the code itself. This is only one possible file extension, and other common ones are `.cc`, `.cxx`, or `.c++`. We stick with `.cpp` in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that some people advocate using IDEs for C++ (such as Qt Creator), and for larger projects, this can be very helpful, as we need to link many different files, which an IDE can help with. In this course however, we will stick mainly to single file C++ programs, and so getting a dedicated C++ IDE is not necessary."

    "### The hello_world program\n",
    "In our fresh file, we enter our *Hello, World* code. Which will look something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    std::cout << \"Hello, world!\" << std::endl;\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "Before we cover how to compile and run this code, let us read through and analyze what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program starts out with an `#include` statement, which is like importing files in Python. This statement means we are including a so-called *header file* (more on headers later). Here we include the standard header `iostream` (input-output stream). We need to include this header to be able to output our message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we define a function named `main`. In C++, we have to define a *main function*. Executing the program is the same as calling this function. It has to be specifically named `main`, or you will get an error. We write `int main()` because our function *returns an integer*, is named *main*, and takes no input. The contents of our function go between two curly braces (`{` `}`). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/function_declaration.png\" width=300>\n",
    "<center><b>Figure 1:</b> Declaring the <i>main</i> function of a C++ program.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside our main function, we do two things:\n",
    "1. we write out our message, \n",
    "2. we return the integer 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we write out our message we use `std::cout`, this isn't the only way to print in C++, but it is the recommended way. Here, `std::cout` is an *output stream*, and anything we insert into this stream will be written out. We insert things using double angel brackets (`<<`). We then write out our message as a text string, using `\"` as delimiters (In Python we use `\"` and `'` interchangeably, but in C++ `\"` denote string literals, while `'` denote single character literals). We have to end each statement in C++ with a semicolon (`;`), so we end our output line with a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing `cout << a << b` just outputs the two things in order, so here we first insert our message, and then `std::endl`. Here *endl* stands for *end line*, and is basically just a newline character. An alternative to inserting `std::endl` would have been to just write in a newline character in our string: `\"Hello, world!\\n\"`. (There is a subtle difference between using `endl` and `\\n`, you can read about it on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/213907/c-stdendl-vs-n) if you are curious).\n",
    "\n",
    "We write `std::` because we are using variables that come from the `iostream` header, and this is a *standard* header, and so `std::` means we are accessing something contained in the `std` namespace. If we import from other packages, we would need a different namespace, such as `arma::` (for the [Armadillo libraries](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)) or `boost::` (for the [Boost libraries](Boost C++ Libraries)). In most of our programs, we won't use that many packages, and we will mostly stick to standard headers, which in turn means we will write a *lot* of `std::`, which is a bit annoying. What we can do to avoid this is to declare `using namespace std;` at the top of our program. This tells the compiler that when we call a function, it will look for the given function in the `std` namespace, and so we can replace `std::cout` with just `cout`, and so on. For our `hello_world.cpp` script, this doesn't help that much on tidiness, but in larger codes, having a single declaration instead of dozens of `std::` can be preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we return `0` from our main function by writing `return 0;`, the same as in Python except for the fact that we need to end our statement with a semicolon. After returning, we are done with our function declaration, so we include our closing curly brace (`}`). Why do we return 0? Recall that our main function is the function that is called by the system when we want to execute our program. When the program finishes, we should return something to the system so that it knows the program is finished. It is customary to return an integer, and we return 0 if the program terminated successfully. If the program aborted or crashed, we return any other integer. Depending on what caused the erroneous termination, we can return a different number, which would be an *error code*, that can tell the system something about what went wrong. We won't use these much in this course, simply put, we always return 0 at the end of our main function, and if something goes wrong, we will instead raise an exception.\n",

    "### Compiling and Running C++ programs\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now written and analyzed our C++ code, but how do we actually run it? Here, things will be quite different from Python, because C++ code first needs to be *compiled* before we can run it. \n",

    "##### Interpreted vs Compiled Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major differences between Python and C++ is that Python is an *interpreted* language, while C++ is a *compiled* language. When we write a Python program, our source code, and our program, is one and the same. To run our program we invoke the Python interpreter, which reads our code and executes it as it goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For C++ programs however, we write our code to a file, but this file cannot be executed directly. Instead we have to turn our source code into an executable program, and this step is known as *compiling the code*. We compile code by invoking a C++ compiler that reads our code. However, unlike the Python interpreter, the compiler doesn't execute our code, instead it translates it into low-level executable machine code, making sure to specialize our code to the system we are compiling on. What we end up with is an *executable*, a program we can execute to run. This program is now executed directly by our machine, and we don't need to invoke a separate \"C++ interpreter\", as the code has already been translated to codes the machine can understand."

The compiler might protest and abort when compiling the source code, in which case we get no executable.

However, some errors are not found by the compiler, and these might sneak into our executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming executables\n",
    "\n",
    "The name `a.out` is generic and not very descriptive. To improve this, we should compile our program into an executable with a specific name. We do this by adding an output-flag: `-o name`, where you can name the executable whatever you want: so for example:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Other compiler flags\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add other flags to the compiler to give it special instructs or extra information, and we will return to this later. A common one to include is `-Wall` (for \"Warning all\") that tells the compiler to give us warnings if it sees things it is skeptical about. So we would do\n",
    "```\n",
    "g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello -Wall\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that *warnings* in this context is not the same as an *error*. An error causes our compilation to terminate, while with warnings, we do get an executable, but the compiler believes we are doing something that is inefficient or error prone. Ironically, `-Wall` doesn't give all possible warnings, so you could add `-Wextra` to get some more warnings (and other `-W` flags, there are quite a lot possible for specific purposes). \n"

Note that `i++` means an increment, similar to `i += 1`. With this syntax, the for-loop is defined with the same logic as a while-loop.

    "\n",
    "From Python, you are used to whitespace not mattering much, with the exception of *newline* characters and *leading* whitespace, i.e., indentation. In C++, however, whitespace matters even less, and this includes newline characters and indentation. As we always include semicolons at the end of statements in C++, we don't need to use newlines between different statements, and because we use curly braces to define scopes, we do not need to use indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while newlines and indentation are not strictly necessary for the code to function, we should use them to increase structure and help readability. But if newlines and indentation doesn't impact the behavior of code, it means we can choose to do these things in different ways, and so it because a style choice. In C and C++ there are many different style choices of indentation, newlines and bracketing, and there is a large [Wikipedia article on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style) you can read if you are curious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going to much into detail, one major point of contention is whether to place the *opening* brace of a function definition or a control structure on the same line as the control statement, or on a separate line immediately below it\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int main() {\n",

    "        ...\n",
    "    }\n",

    "    {\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you are looking at C++ code in books or online, you will see both styles used, it comes down to preference. I prefer the first style, which is called the *\"One True Brace Style\"* (OTBS/1TBS). I prefer this style because it makes the C++-code look as much like my Python code as possible, and it avoids having blank lines separating the function/loop definition from its contents. Having the closing brace on separate line however, is useful, as this blank line gives some space to the following code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend you stick to the OTBS style in IN1910. As always, regardless of what style you want to follow, the most important thing is to be consistent in your style.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single-statement loops and tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important thing to note about braces in C++ is that in a control structure with a single statement, you can opt to skip the braces altogether. For example:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "if (is_prime(i)) {\n",
    "    cout << i << \" is prime\" << endl;\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    cout << i << \" is prime\" << endl;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "could just as well be written\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "if (is_prime(i))\n",
    "    cout << i << \" is prime\" << endl;\n",
    "else\n",
    "    cout << i << \" is prime\" << endl;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Some prefer to write the latter, because it looks nicer without the brackets. The OTB style states that this shouldn't be done however, because it can easily lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you always use braces, even for single statements, you can always go back and add more statements later, and things will work just as well. If you omit the braces however, when you add the second statement, it actually goes *outside* the control structure. This means the first style is a lot safer and extendable than the second. We therefore recommend that you *always use your braces*, it will save you from bugs that can potentially cost you a lot of frustration and time down the road. I once spent several days finding a bug in my code because I added a second statement to a loop that didn't use brackets, and so now I try to always use brackets."
