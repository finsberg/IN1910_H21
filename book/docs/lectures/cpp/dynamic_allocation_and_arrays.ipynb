    "```C++\n",
    "int x[100];\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `x` will be an array of 100 ints. We can access these by indexing: `x[0]`, `x[1]`, $\\ldots$, `x[n-1]`.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we stated that an array will be *contiguous* in memory, i.e., each element follows each other directly. We can check this statement by writing out the memory addresses:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "cout << &x[0] << endl;\n",
    "cout << &x[1] << endl;\n",
    "cout << &x[2] << endl;\n",
    "cout << &x[3] << endl;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which prints out:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "0x7ffed0407920\n",
    "0x7ffed0407924\n",
    "0x7ffed0407928\n",
    "0x7ffed040792c\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the memory address increases by 4 every step (it goes 8->c because it is hexadecimal), this is because memory addresses are in terms of byte (8 bits), and integers are 32-bit variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the \"crazy\" part, if we write out the array variable itself:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "cout << x << endl;\n",
    "```\n",
    "we get:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0x7ffed0407920\n",
    "```\n",
    "Not only is this a memory address, it's the same address as the first element: `x[0]`. This fact indicates that the array variable `x`, is almost the same as a pointer to the first variable of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us highlight this in another way. Look at the following code snippet:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int x[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12};\n",
    "int *y = &x[2];\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we make an array, and then make an integer pointer and set it to point at the third element, with a value of 6. However, because array variables behave much like pointers to the first element, the reverse is also true. Now `y` will behave like an array:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "cout << y[0] << \" \";\n",
    "cout << y[1] << \" \";\n",
    "cout << y[2] << \" \";\n",
    "cout << y[3] << endl;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is because the square bracket indexing indicates looking at the next elements in memory, and so will behave just like an array. We could also have accessed the elements using *pointer arithmetic*:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "cout << *(y) << \" \";\n",
    "cout << *(y + 1) << \" \";\n",
    "cout << *(y + 2) << \" \";\n",
    "cout << *(y + 3) << endl;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, derefercing `y` itself gives the first element, by computing `y + 1` we go the the next integer in memory, which would be element 2, and so on.\n"
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "Thus, a pointer is variable that stores the memory address of some data type, but if these data lie contiguously in memory, then having the address of the first element is all we need to reference the whole set. Thus, an `int *` pointer, can point to a single integer, or to a whole sequence of them. Note that the pointer itself does not know how many elements it points, like an array does not know how many elements it contains—meaning you won't get an `IndexError` if you go out of bounds, you get undefined behavior.

However, we have only pointed it at things that already exist. However, it is possible to get a pointer to point at something brand new. Take a look at the following example:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int *x;\n",
    "x = new int;\n",
    "*x = 5;\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "We have discussed how arrays are so efficient because they are contiguous in memory, but we find it annoying that they don't remember their size. We therefore decide we want to make a class called `Array` that stores both the data array and the size of it as a single object. We first define the object as\n",

    "public:\n",

    "    int size;\n",

    "```\n",
    "Where `data` is a pointer to the first element of the underlying array, and `size` the number of elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we turn to making the constructor. When we make the constructor we want to take in the number of elements we want as an integer. The constructor should then allocate the memory of the array, set all the elements to zero, and point the `data` pointer to this array. You might try to do the following, but it won't work:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(NB: Doesn't actually work)**\n",

    "    data = tmp;\n",
    "    size = n;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "While this looks reasonable, there is a big problem. Whenever a function finishes, everything created inside that function is automatically destroyed. As the array is created inside the constructor, it is destroyed too. Our pointer is set to point at this array, but if the thing pointed at is destroyed, the pointer won't be much good.\n",
    "If we try to run the following code\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "Array a(10);\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < a.size; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    cout << a.data[i] << \" \";\n",
    "}\n",

    "it produces the output \n",
    "```\n",
    "0 1 31872064 1 31872064 1 30535429 1 31872064 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "and this output will change every time you run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when using dynamic memory allocation, the data is not destroyed at the end of the function, and so will survive. To dynamically allocate an array, we do the following:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "Array (int n) {\n",
    "    data = new int[n];\n",
