    "### What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP for short), is a [*programming paradigm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). Put simply, a paradigm is a way to think about, organize, and write code. Paradigms are used to classify and describe languages and programming styles. Many other paradigms exists, and you might have heard of some of them. Some examples are: procedural programming, functional programming, imperative programming, and symbolic programming. A programming language or piece of software doesn't necessarily belong to a single paradigm, and there aren't hard lines between the different paradigm either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a way of solving problems, or building software, by defining data as *objects*, and specifying how those objects behave and interact. It is quite a popular way of developing software, because when done correctly it leads to code that is easy to understand, use and extend. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The origins of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming was invented in Norway by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard in 1967, they called their new language, the first object-oriented language, *Simula*. While Simula was revolutionary and historically important language, it didn't see widespread adoption. Inspired by Simula, the language *Smalltalk* came on the scene in 1972 and saw a wider use, pushing the use of OOP. Smalltalk still sees use today, mainly as a means of teaching OOP and introductory programming. In 1983 *C++* arrived on the scene, and can be described as the first \"industrial\" object-oriented language. C++ was invented by Bjarne Stroustrup. He thought Simula had some nice features for large software development, but considered it to be to slow to be practical. He therefore started developing *\"C with classes\"*, which would eventually become C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most popular modern computer languages are *multi-paradigm*, meaning they support multiple possible paradigms. Some popular modern languages that support object-orientation are Python, Java, C++, C#, PHP, and Ruby."

    "#### What are objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, all variables are *objects*. Each object is of a given *type* (string, list, dictionary, etc) and it has some data stored in it. In addition, the objects has some defined behavior for how we interact with it, and how it interacts with other objects. We can for example append new elements to a list, or add lists together. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of of the reasons OOP is so intuitive is that it mirrors real life. To make sense of the world around us when we think or talk we tend to divide everything into specific conecepts or *objects*. Cars are objects, buildings, people are objects too in the software sense. It isn't only physical things that are objects either, we split time into hours, days, and years. And these are objects too. We can think of a \"job\" as a object. In this sense, an object is a data abstraction that attempts to capture some important property or feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in Python are objects, so when you are programming in Python, you are defining and using objects all the time. Does this mean you are programming object-oriented? Not necessarily. As we mentioned in the introduction the important thing is *thinking* and *solving problems* in an object-oriented manner. Meaning to do OOP properly one should ask what kind of objects are best for organizing a program and solving problems. Probably the most important task of programming object-oriented is therefore to define new data types, and defining how objects of that type should be represented and interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: A contact list\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the contact list on your phone. For each contact, you can store information of different types: name, different phone numbers, emails, etc. Some contacts you have many pieces of information about, some you only have a single piece of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say we want to implement such a contact list for a new phone system we are making. We might start thinking how to solve this problem. It makes sense to think of each individual contact as an individual *object*. Each piece of information belongs to a given contact, so it should be part of that object in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we only want to store information about each contact, and so dictionaries would be a natural choice for this. We can use key-value pairs to store the information we want, and ignore the pieces of information we don't want. Other parts of the software system can then go in and access information from the contact dictionary as needed"

    "### Attributes, Fields, Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are custom data types, and are extremely central to object-oriented programming. When you are developing object-oriented, most of your development will go into defining classes and how they interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a new class, you need to specify what data an object of that type should contain, and what functionality it has. We call these the *attributes* of the class/object, and these can be split into two groupings:\n",
    "* fields are pieces of data stored in the object\n",
    "* methods are functions we can call\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class vs Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a class, we are defining a new data type. To actually use it, we have to define a new object of that type, we call this an *instance* of the class. In our contact-list example, the `Contact` class is the general class we defined, then we can implement specific instances of the class, one for \"Lisa\", one for \"Frank\" and so on. The class is thus the abstract *concept* of a contact, and objects are the specific cases of that type. A different example: A Nissan leaf is a given type of car, and can be represented as a class. A specific car with the licensce plate \"EM93277\" (courtesy of random.org) is an *instance* of the Nissan leaf class. The specific car is an object of the *type* Nissan leaf. In this sense, the class is like the blue-print, it specifies how objects of that type should be built.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?#class-names) style-guide (more on this next week), class names should use the CapWords convention (also known as CamelCase). This means every word in the class name should be capitalized, and the words should **not** be separated by underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples: `Person`, `Polynomial`, `Vector3D`, `BankAccount`, `FileReader`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific instances of a class however, should always be lowercase. So when we define a variable of a given class, we would write for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "u = Vector3D()\n",
    "poly = Polynomial()\n",
    "acc9302100 = BankAccount()\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should be strict about this rule, as it makes it much easier to differentiate the *classes* themselves (the general datatype) from instances of that class (the specific objects) in your code."

However, for most card games, we need to use the exact same operations: get a new deck, shuffle the deck, draw cards, etc. It would be useful to implement the code to do this one place, and then just use that functionality each time we implement a new card game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by implementing a `Deck` class. After having implemented our class, our game code itself will be much simpler, because we can now simply call `deck.shuffle()` or `deck.draw(5)` and so on. This adds a layer of abstraction to our code, and hides away the ugly implementation details \"behind the scenes\". This is called *encapsulation*, and is one of the motivations for using OOP.

And so when we define the function we call the first input-argument `self`, because this is the *object itself* (in this case `self = deck`). Note that you can, technically, call this argument something other than `self`, it is just a function argument, like any other.

If you build a large and complex class, all anyone really needs to interact with it is a good understanding of its interface. In this sense, the interface itself is an abstraction tool.

    "There are several advantages to implementing these quadratic functions as actual Quadratic-objects, rather than as normal Python functions. For one, they now have a custom type, which we can check using `isinstance(f, Quadratic)`. Thus, other parts of our code *knows* that the function is a quadratic function. We can also extend the class adding plenty of useful functionality. We could for example add functionality for adding or subtracting functions, producing new Quadratic-objects. This cannot be done with normal functions. Or we could add a method for returning the derivative. If you do this week's exercises, you will get the chance to implement all of these for a general degree polynomial."
