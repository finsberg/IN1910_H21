## Installing third party packages with conda

For the course IN1910 you need to install the following software:

- Python version 3.7 or newer
- [SciPy stack](https://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html)
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html)

This can be installed using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) which is recommended. There are also other options to install [python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) depending on your operating system. You may also consult the [guide from IN1900](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN1900/h18/ressurser/installering.html). In addition you need to install

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A text-editor. 

For the C++ part of the course you will also need a C++ compiler.

An alternative to install this software on your own computers is to [connect to an IFI-machine remotely](https://termvakt.uio.no/Fjerninnlogging). This is a good alternative if you have technical problems on you own machine.
