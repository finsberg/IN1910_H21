## Exam

IN1910 is project based with a Pass/Fail grade. There will be one small individual project and three larger projects during the semester. The three larger projects can be done in pairs. In addition to the projects work we will have a short oral exam where you will present one of the three last projects. To get a passing grade you will need to pass all four projects (50%) in order to qualify to take the final exam. If you fail one of the projects, but have delivered some work, we will give you a chance to improve your project and submit again. 

During the oral you will be asked to present one of the projects (randomly chosen between project 1, 2 and 3). In addition you will be asked about other topics from the curriculum.

Please note that because all the projects are considered part of the basis of the course grade, you must apply for extensions on any mandatory work were required. You can do this directly to the administration at [studieinfo@ifi.uio.no](mailto:studieinfo@ifi.uio.no). Please do so before the deadline has expired if possible.
