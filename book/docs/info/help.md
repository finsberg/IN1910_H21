# Getting help or give feedback

## Padlet

In this class we have also set up [padlet](https://uio.padlet.org/krihus/in1910) which you can use to ask questions about anything related to the course as well as help your fellow students. Here you can ask questions anonymously and also comment on other questions.

## Feedback from Students

If you have any comments, thoughts, criticisms or suggestions, please do not hesitate to let us know! You can contact the lecturer directly, in person or by email (henriknf@simula.no). You can also let your TA/gruppel√¶rer know, so they can bring it along. For complaints of a serious nature, or if you want to remain anonymous, we recommend you contact the administration at IFI directly, or get in touch with one of the student unions:
* [Fagutvalget ved Institutt for informatikk](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/livet-rundt-studiene/organisasjoner/fui.html)
* [Matematisk Fagutvalg](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/livet-rundt-studiene/studentdemokrati/matematisk-fagutvalg/)
