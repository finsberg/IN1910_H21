# Coursework

There will be handed out four projects during the semester, and it will be possible to collect points on each project. A total of 100 points can be collected in total. 10 points can be collected at the first project, while the remaining projects all give maximum 30 points.
You need to get 50% correct on each project (5 points on project 1 and 15 points on the remaining projects) and 70 points in total in order to qualify to take the oral exam.

Note that in this course you will only get a pass/fail grade. However you can, after completing the course, request a diploma which will state how many points your were able to get.

More information about the projects will come later. For each week there will also be corresponding exercises which you are strongly encouraged to solve.
